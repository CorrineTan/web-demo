# web-demo
This is a demo for building scalable web applications using various AWS building blocks.

The demo code only contains two PHP files: config.php and index.php. The aws-sdk-for-php contains AWS SDK for PHP version 2.7.17.

I put my investigations, steps I followed, bugs I met in my (this git repo's) wiki page.
